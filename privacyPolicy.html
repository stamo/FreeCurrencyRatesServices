            <p>Free Currency Converter is using Internet connection in order to provide to the client updated and precise information about currency rates.</p>
            <p>Free Currency Converter does not record any personal information. The only personal information it  needs is the home currency of the client. In order to provide relevant information, on the first launch the IP of the client is checked against IP database and the currency code is recorded. Neither IP nor other personal information, except  currency code, is recorded or used by the application. This record can be changed at any time by pressing "My Currency" button on the application bar.</p>
